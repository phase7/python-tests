<h2>Introduction</h2>

<h3>About this document</h3>
<p>
udev is targeted at Linux kernels 2.6 and beyond to provide a userspace solution 
for a dynamic /dev directory, with persistent device naming. The previous /dev 
implementation, <i>devfs</i>, is now deprecated, and udev is seen as the successor.
udev vs devfs is a sensitive area of conversation - you should read <a 
href="http://kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/udev_vs_devfs">this 
document</a> before making comparisons.
</p>
<p>
Over the years, the things that you might use udev rules for has changed, as well 
as the flexibility of rules themselves. On a modern system, udev provides 
persistent naming for some device types out-of-the-box, eliminating the need for 
custom rules for those devices. However, some users will still require the extra 
level of customisation.
</p>
<p>
This document assumes that you have udev installed and running OK with default 
configurations. This is usually handled by your Linux distribution.
</p>
<p>
This document does not cover every single detail of rule writing, but does aim to 
introduce all of the main concepts. The finer details can be found in the udev man 
page.
</p>
<p>
This document uses various examples (many of which are entirely fictional) to 
illustrate ideas and concepts. Not all syntax is explicitly described in the 
accompanying text, be sure to look at the example rules to get a complete 
understanding.

<h2>The concepts</h2>
<a name="terminology"></a>
<h3>Terminology: devfs, sysfs, nodes, etc.</h3>
<p>
A basic introduction only, might not be totally accurate.
</p>
<p>
On typical Linux-based systems, the <i>/dev</i> directory is used to store file-
like device <b>nodes</b> which refer to certain devices in the system. Each node 
points to a part of the system (a device), which might or might not exist. 
Userspace applications can use these device nodes to interface with the systems 
hardware, for example, the X server will "listen to" /dev/input/mice so that it can
relate the user's mouse movements to moving the visual mouse pointer.
</p>
<p>
The original <i>/dev</i> directories were just populated with every device that 
might possibly appear in the system. /dev directories were typically very large 
because of this. <b>devfs</b> came along to provide a more manageable approach 
(noticeably, it only populated /dev with hardware that is plugged into the system),
as well as some other functionality, but the system proved to have problems which 
could not be easily fixed.
</p>
<p>
<b>udev</b> is the "new" way of managing <i>/dev</i> directories, designed to clear
up some issues with previous <i>/dev</i> implementations, and provide a robust path
forward. In order to create and name <i>/dev</i> device nodes corresponding to 
devices that are present in the system, udev relies on matching information 
provided by <i>sysfs</i> with <i>rules</i> provided by the user. This documentation
aims to detail the process of rule-writing, one of the only udev-related tasks that
must (optionally) be performed by the user.
</p>
<p>
<b>sysfs</b> is a new filesystem to the 2.6 kernels. It is managed by the kernel, 
and exports basic information about the devices currently plugged into your system.
udev can use this information to create device nodes corresponding to your 
hardware. sysfs is mounted at <i>/sys</i> and is browseable. You may wish to 
investigate some of the files stored there before getting to grips with udev. 
Throughout this document, I will use the terms <i>/sys</i> and <i>sysfs</i> 
interchangeably.
</p>
<a name="why"></a>
<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>
udev rules are flexible and very powerful. Here are some of the things you can use 
rules to achieve:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Rename a device node from the default name to something else</li>
<li>Provide an alternative/persistent name for a device node by creating a symbolic
link to the default device node</li>
<li>Name a device node based on the output of a program</li>
<li>Change permissions and ownership of a device node</li>
<li>Launch a script when a device node is created or deleted (typically when a 
device is attached or unplugged)</li>
<li>Rename network interfaces</li>
</ul>
<p>
Writing rules is <u>not</u> a workaround for the problem where no device nodes for 
your particular device exist. Even if there are no matching rules, udev will create
the device node with the default name supplied by the kernel.
</p>
<p>
Having persistently named device nodes has several advantages. Assume you own two 
USB storage devices: a digital camera and a USB flash disk. These devices are 
typically assigned device nodes <em>/dev/sda</em> and <em>/dev/sdb</em> but the 
exact assignment depends on the order which they were originally connected. This 
may cause problems to some users, who would benefit greatly if each device could be
named persistently every time, e.g. <em>/dev/camera</em> and 
<em>/dev/flashdisk</em>.
</p>
<a name="builtin"></a>
<h3>Built-in persistent naming schemes</h3>
<p>
udev provides persistent naming for some device types out of the box. This is a 
very useful feature, and in many circumstances means that your journey ends here: 
you do not have to write any rules.
</p>
<p>
udev provides out-of-the-box persistent naming for storage devices in the 
<em>/dev/disk</em> directory. To view the persistent names which have been created 
for your storage hardware, you can use the following command:
</p>
<blockquote><pre># ls -lR /dev/disk</pre></blockquote>
<p>
This works for all storage types. As an example, udev has created <em>/dev/disk/by-
id/scsi-SATA_ST3120827AS_4MS1NDXZ-part3</em> which is a persistent-named symbolic 
link to my root partition. udev creates <em>/dev/disk/by-id/usb-
Prolific_Technology_Inc._USB_Mass_Storage_Device-part1</em> when I plug my USB 
flash disk in, which is also a persistent name.
</p>
<!-- FIXME: document CDROM persistent naming when things settle down -->
<h2>Rule writing</h2>
<a name="files"></a>
<h3>Rule files and semantics</h3>
<p>
When deciding how to name a device and which additional actions to perform, udev 
reads a series of rules files. These files are kept in the 
<em>/etc/udev/rules.d</em> directory, and they all must have the <em>.rules</em> 
suffix.
</p>
<p>
Default udev rules are stored in <em>/etc/udev/rules.d/50-udev.rules</em>. You may 
find it interesting to look over this file - it includes a few examples, and then 
some default rules proving a devfs-style /dev layout. However, you should not write
rules into this file directly.
</p>
<p>
Files in /etc/udev/rules.d/ are parsed in <b>lexical</b> order, and in some 
circumstances, the order in which rules are parsed is important. In general, you 
want your own rules to be parsed before the defaults, so I suggest you create a 
file at <em>/etc/udev/rules.d/10-local.rules</em> and write all your rules into 
this file.
</p>
<p>
In a rules file, lines starting with "#" are treated as comments. Every other non-
blank line is a rule. Rules cannot span multiple lines.
</p>
<p>
One device can be matched by more than one rule. This has it's practical 
advantages, for example, we can write two rules which match the same device, where 
each one provides its own alternate name for the device. Both alternate names will 
be created, even if the rules are in separate files. It is important to understand 
that udev will <em>not</em> stop processing when it finds a matching rule, it will 
continue searching and attempt to apply every rule that it knows about.
</p>
<a name="syntax"></a>
<h3>Rule syntax</h3>
<p>
Each rule is constructed from a series of key-value pairs, which are separated by 
commas. <b>match</b> keys are conditions used to identify the device which the rule
is acting upon. When <u>all</u> match keys in a rule correspond to the device being
handled, then the rule is applied and the actions of the <b>assignment</b> keys are
invoked. Every rule should consist of at least one match key and at least one 
assignment key.
</p>
<p>
Here is an example rule to illustrate the above:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>KERNEL=="hdb", NAME="my_spare_disk"</pre></blockquote>
<p>
The above rule includes one match key (<em>KERNEL</em>) and one assignment key 
(<em>NAME</em>). The semantics of these keys and their properties will be detailed 
later. It is important to note that the match key is related to its value through 
the equality operator (==), whereas the assignment key is related to its value 
through the assignment operator (=).
</p>
<p>
Be aware that udev does not support any form of line continuation. Do not insert 
any line breaks in your rules, as this will cause udev to see your one rule as 
multiple rules and will not work as expected.
</p>
<a name="basic"></a>
<h3>Basic Rules</h3>
<p>
udev provides several different match keys which can be used to write rules which 
match devices very precisely. Some of the most common keys are introduced below, 
others will be introduced later in this document. For a complete list, see the udev
man page.
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>KERNEL</b> - match against the kernel name for the device</li>
<li><b>SUBSYSTEM</b> - match against the subsystem of the device</li>
<li><b>DRIVER</b> - match against the name of the driver backing the device</li>
</ul>
<p>
After you have used a series of match keys to precisely match a device, udev gives 
you fine control over what happens next, through a range of assignment keys. For a 
complete list of possible assignment keys, see the udev man page. The most basic 
assignment keys are introduced below. Others will be introduced later in this 
document.
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>NAME</b> - the name that shall be used for the device node</li>
<li><b>SYMLINK</b> - a <b>list</b> of symbolic links which act as alternative names
for the device node</li>
</ul>
<p>
As hinted above, udev only creates one true device node for one device. If you wish
to provide alternate names for this device node, you use the symbolic link 
functionality. With the <em>SYMLINK</em> assignment, you are actually maintaining a
<em>list</em> of symbolic links, all of which will be pointed at the real device 
node. To manipulate these links, we introduce a new operator for appending to 
lists: <b>+=</b>. You can append multiple symlinks to the list from any one rule by
separating each one with a space.
</p>
<blockquote><pre>KERNEL=="hdb", NAME="my_spare_disk"</pre></blockquote>
<p>
The above rule says: <em>match a device which was named by the kernel as hdb, and 
instead of calling it hdb, name the device node as my_spare_disk</em>. The device 
node appears at <em>/dev/my_spare_disk</em>.
</p>
<blockquote><pre>KERNEL=="hdb", DRIVER=="ide-disk", 
SYMLINK+="sparedisk"</pre></blockquote>
<p>
The above rule says: <em>match a device which was named by the kernel as hdb AND 
where the driver is ide-disk. Name the device node with the default name and create
a symbolic link to it named sparedisk</em>. Note that we did not specify a device 
node name, so udev uses the default. In order to preserve the standard 
<em>/dev</em> layout, your own rules will typically leave the NAME alone but create
some SYMLINKs and/or perform other assignments.
</p>
<blockquote><pre>KERNEL=="hdc", SYMLINK+="cdrom cdrom0"</pre></blockquote>
<p>
The above rule is probably more typical of the types of rules you might be writing.
It creates two symbolic links at <em>/dev/cdrom</em> and <em>/dev/cdrom0</em>, both
of which point at <em>/dev/hdc</em>. Again, no NAME assignment was specified, so 
the default kernel name (hdc) is used.
</p>
<a name="sysfsmatch"></a>
<h3>Matching sysfs attributes</h3>
<p>
The match keys introduced so far only provide limited matching capabilities. 
Realistically we require much finer control: we want to identify devices based on 
advanced properties such as vendor codes, exact product numbers, serial numbers, 
storage capacities, number of partitions, etc.
</p>
<p>
Many drivers export information like this into sysfs, and udev allows us to 
incorporate sysfs-matching into our rules, using the <em>ATTR</em> key with a 
slightly different syntax.
</p>
<p>
Here is an example rule which matches a single attribute from sysfs. Further detail
will be provided later in this document which will aid you in writing rules based 
on sysfs attributes.
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
SUBSYSTEM=="block", ATTR{size}=="234441648", SYMLINK+="my_disk"
</pre></blockquote>
<a name="hierarchy"></a>
<h3>Device hierarchy</h3>
<p>
The Linux kernel actually represents devices in a tree-like structure, and this 
information is exposed through sysfs and useful when writing rules. For example, 
the device representation of my hard disk device is a child of the SCSI disk 
device, which is in turn a child of the Serial ATA controller device, which is in 
turn a child of the PCI bus device. It is likely that you will find yourself 
needing to refer to information from a parent of the device in question, for 
example the serial number of my hard disk device is not exposed at the device 
level, it is exposed by its direct parent at the SCSI disk level.
</p>
<p>
The four main match keys introduced so far (KERNEL/SUBSYSTEM/DRIVER/ATTR) only 
match against values corresponding to the device in question, and do not match 
values from parent devices. udev provides variants of the match keys that will 
search upwards through the tree:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>KERNELS</b> - match against the kernel name for the device, or the kernel 
name for any of the parent devices</li>
<li><b>SUBSYSTEMS</b> - match against the subsystem of the device, or the subsystem
of any of the parent devices</li>
<li><b>DRIVERS</b> - match against the name of the driver backing the device, or 
the name of the driver backing any of the parent devices</li>
<li><b>ATTRS</b> - match a sysfs attribute of the device, or a sysfs attribute of 
any of the parent devices</li>
</ul>
<p>
With hierarchy considerations in mind, you may feel that rule writing is becoming a
little complicated. Rest assured that there are tools that help out here, which 
will be introduced later.
</p>
<a name="strsubst"></a>
<h3>String substitutions</h3>
<p>
When writing rules which will potentially handle multiple similar devices, udev's 
<em>printf-like string substitution operators</em> are very useful. You can simply 
include these operators in any assignments your rule makes, and udev will evaluate 
them when they are executed.
</p>
<p>
The most common operators are <b>%k</b> and <b>%n</b>. %k evaluates to the kernel 
name for the device, e.g. "sda3" for a device that would (by default) appear at 
<em>/dev/sda3</em>. <b>%n</b> evaluates to the kernel number for the device (the 
partition number for storage devices), e.g. "3" for <em>/dev/sda3</em>.
</p>
<p>
udev also provides several other substitution operators for more advanced 
functionality. Consult the udev man page after reading the rest of this document. 
There is also an alternative syntax for these operators - <b>$kernel</b> and 
<b>$number</b> for the examples above. For this reason, if you wish to match a 
literal % in a rule then you must write <b>%%</b>, and if you wish to match a 
literal $ then you must write <b>$$</b>.
</p>
<p>
To illustrate the concept of string substitution, some example rules are shown 
below.
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
KERNEL=="mice", NAME="input/%k"
KERNEL=="loop0", NAME="loop/%n", SYMLINK+="%k"
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
The first rule ensures that the mice device node appears exclusively in the 
<em>/dev/input</em> directory (by default it would be at <em>/dev/mice</em>). The 
second rule ensures that the device node named loop0 is created at 
<em>/dev/loop/0</em> but also creates a symbolic link at <em>/dev/loop0</em> as 
usual.
</p>
<p>
The use of the above rules is questionable, as they all could be rewritten without 
using any substitution operators. The true power of these substitutions will become
apparent in the next section.
</p>
<a name="strmatch"></a>
<h3>String matching</h3>
<p>
As well as matching strings exactly, udev allows you to use shell-style pattern 
matching. There are 3 patterns supported:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>*</b> - match any character, zero or more times</li>
<li><b>?</b> - match any character exactly once</li>
<li><b>[]</b> - match any single character specified in the brackets, ranges are 
also permitted</li>
</ul>
<p>
Here are some examples which incorporate the above patterns. Note the use of the 
string substitution operators.
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
KERNEL=="fd[0-9]*", NAME="floppy/%n", SYMLINK+="%k"
KERNEL=="hiddev*", NAME="usb/%k"
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
The first rule matches all floppy disk drives, and ensures that the device nodes 
are placed in the <em>/dev/floppy</em> directory, as well as creating a symbolic 
link from the default name. The second rule ensures that hiddev devices are only 
present in the <em>/dev/usb</em> directory.
</p>
<h2>Finding information from sysfs</h2>
<a name="sysfstree"></a>
<h3>The sysfs tree</h3>
<p>
The concept of using interesting information from sysfs was briefly touched upon 
above. In order to write rules based on this information, you first need to know 
the names of the attributes and their current values.
</p>
<p>
sysfs is actually a very simple structure. It is logically divided into 
directories. Each directory contains a number of files (<em>attributes</em>) which 
typically contain just one value. Some symbolic links are present, which link 
devices to their parents. The hierarchical structure was touched upon above.
</p>
<p>
Some directories are referred to as <em>top-level device paths</em>. These 
directories represent actual devices that have corresponding device nodes. Top-
level device paths can be classified as sysfs directories which contain a 
<em>dev</em> file, the following command will list these for you:
</p>
